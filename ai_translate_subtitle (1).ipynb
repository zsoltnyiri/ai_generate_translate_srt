            " Hello everyone, good afternoon! This is a very interesting topic. Why do we have to talk about the dog? Why do we talk about the dog? Why don't we talk about the dog? Well, we say that we have to talk about the dog. We don't hold this presentation by accident, we don't at this moment, we are in the middle of a huge change, a dog paradigm shift. I would like to prove this right away. I would like to start with a question. put your hand on the dog's hand who chose a specific dog for you. So when he went to the dog house, he went to the dog house, then he looked at the little dog with that eye, that he would be a racing dog from Egiliti, or a lion dog, or he would hunt with you. Put your hand on the hand who chose your dog like this. Three, four, five. Thank you. And now I would like to ask you to raise your hand if you chose your dog as a family member. You went to the dog for a walk. Okay, and you raised your hand, by the way, who is the first. If I had raised this question a hundred years ago, I would have got exactly the same ratio. Exactly the same, just reversed. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the dog paradigm shift. And in this soul-teaching, we just look a little bit to see what I think. The dog is here with us today, in the family, in the human family. Specifically, I have a Caucasian shepherd dog, and although we have a nice big house, but it sleeps in the living room and the bedroom. This is how we live with the dog today. However, this was not exactly the case in the past few thousand years. But all in all, if I look at the relationship between man and dog, I will notice a very interesting phenomenon. Some say that it is 150,000 years, some say that it is only 50,000 years. It depends on what you say that it is only for 150,000 years, others say that it is only for 50,000 years. It depends on what you say about it. There are completely different definitions of science. I want to start from 150,000 years. We live with the dog for 150,000 years. The dog spent 145-147 thousand years in the sunbed and the bedroom. And only in the last 3-4 thousand years did we put him out. He was brought out to the yard, to the gate. Before that, he lived with us in the sunbed and the bedroom. That was a very big change when, at the beginning of our written history, the dog practically distanced itself from man, but to predict that, the human and the dog would be again in a very close proximity, would be again in the human family, in the human bedroom and in the bedroom. This can be argued, but it is too much. This has happened, this is now, this is how we live with the dog today, and that's exactly why what is happening now, this is how we live with the dog today. And that's exactly why we have to talk about who is the miracle, what is the miracle of this dog. Because, please, with the fact that the dog has moved into the human family, we have taken a lot of responsibility with it. And actually, I would like to talk about this responsibility now in the time ahead of us. Well, let's get into it and see what I think. What are the actual needs of the dog, how does the dog work? The mirror method basically says that the dog is doing fine. We don't really have to teach the dog, but he's waiting for his owner to arrive. And that's why you and the man and dog is placed on three levels. These three levels are teaching, relationship management and lifestyle. Today I'm going to talk about this. Typically, the most common is relationship management, but to get a wider picture of the dog, I would like to look a little bit out of the teaching and the lifestyle. Let's start with the lifestyle. What does it mean to be a lifestyle? It's a popular word, we really like to use it today. Well, the situation is that when the dog was not in the human family yet, but we used the dog for something, then we took the dog's energy. If we go back, so we go back to the pre-human coexistence period, then we see that he was able to give his energy in an exciting way as a fox. Our dogs don't have that luck in this respect, because we can't always use the dog's energy. What happens then? Help me. What happens if I can't use the dog's energy? What happens if I can't control the dog's energy? What happens? And what happens if I'm angry? I go home, I open the door and see that he has controlled the dog's energy. It wasn't funny then, and I laugh at it today. I'm laughing at this, but this is the basis. And people say, oh, it's so bad, it's so bad. Well, please, the fact that the dog is tearing apart the apartment, the dog is tearing apart the apartment, it's like, it's going to the dog like the Mercedes to the air conditioner. I'm asking a Mercedes without air conditioners. There's nothing like that. I'm asking a dog without bad things. Let me tell you where you can find a dog like this. I haven't met him yet. Thank God. Okay, that's fine. Of course, you can start with this. So there's a chance to treat it, but how? Let's look at what's more problematic. When the dog doesn't pick up the apartment, but the energy of the raised bed, this energy that is not led down, where does it appear? Indeed, in behavior disorders, in aggression. Most of the behavior problems can be brought back here, the energy that has not been led down. And then there is another one that is even worse than this, when this energy overload attacks the body's primary immune system, and the dog becomes much more exposed to diseases. Dogs are very sick today. So, for those who have had a dog 30-40 years ago, I have similar experts with me, I assume you do, we remember that 30-40 years ago dogs were not so sick. We remember that 30-40 years ago dogs were not so sick. Our dogs are very sick today. And of course there is nutrition, there is the fact that the air is worse, but these are inferior to what the lifestyle means. If I can provide a good lifestyle for the dog, then please, the dog's health status will be drastically improved. Well, please, let's see how you can provide a good lifestyle for the dog's health condition will drastically improve. Well, please, let's see how we can provide a good lifestyle for the dog. Let's start with how this happens with the ancestors. Help me, today you can already know for sure who the dog's ancestor was. The wolf. This is important because when I studied dogology, Dr. Zsolt Kovács didn't teach me this yet, but thanks to the recent genetic tests, we now know that the tail is the owner of the dog. Help me! Where does the tail lead its energy? During hunting and playing. Okay. Especially during hunting. Let's see how a hunter looks like. The hungry wolves tell the boss that he should slowly start hunting. The ladies know this phenomenon well, that how can the hungry wolf be. I trust everyone's imagination on what to think. Okay. The boss sees that he has to go, he sends the signal, they start, they see the hunt, they run away. They destroy. Is this what a hunting looks like? Of course not. But how? So that these hungry, because this is very important, hungry sheep start hunting with the leader's direction. And the leader tells everyone nicely what to do. One of them finds out, the other one is hurrying to out, the third one will be disappointed, the fourth one will decide. The I have two conditions for a good life program. The first is to motivate the dog. What kind of dog does he usually hunt? The hungry dog usually goes hunting. This is the first one to motivate. The second condition is to be guided by the boss. By the boss. Well, let's look at our daily routine. A simple dog keeper who puts Border Collie in the car, goes out... What could be the best life mode program for Border Collie? Give me a tip. Agility is a great idea, but that's where the winning is. Agility is a great life mode program, but it's ten times, if not a hundred times stronger than this, because if you see a Border Collie bear, you're hungry right away. You can imagine that, right? The bear, the bear, the bear. The Border Collie likes to graze. It's hungry in the quoting sign. Okay. The simple dog keeper goes out to the bears, lets the Border Collie out, the Border Collie jumps out, as we have already discussed, and says, Oh, how many dogs! Paf! He runs in and rips them apart. Well, that's not what I thought. Let's see how this should work. Until it's true, oh, how many dogs! Boss, can I go? I say to the boy, okay, boss, you really say, because they are very dogs. And when the boss just comes here once, he brings the two of us here. Here I am, boss, something else, something else. Well, you know, back to the beginning. Here I am, boss, something else, something else. This is it. This is the lifestyle program we're looking for, high motivation, almost with the control of the owner. And how strong it is, that the little boy is talking here or you... Dear ladies, gentlemen, I have done a lot for the health of my dog, and let me give you a quick example to prove that. A long time ago, a lady came to the Népsziget dog school with a Pista Leslie boxer and told her that the dog has everything to worry about. He didn't know how to pet the dog, he had to walk all over the water. This is a strange situation. Kriszta's doctors said that the dog has a half year left. And he thought he wanted to beautify this half year, he set the base, then the mid-level training, then he started to go to control training, one of the forms of defense work. And the defense work of a boxer is like the training of a border collie. So if he is not a sympathetic kid, he'll get hungry right away. If I can't get the mayor, I'll say, okay, you know what, you're talking. And then you get in the office. And if he stops, he stops, and if he moves, he'll hold on until he stops. That was the Mellow, and imagine, of course, of course, it was completely by accident, it was completely by accident, but what happened was that after Lezli started going to the guard, he started to pee himself from the beginning. Obviously, it was a coincidence. But when he was on a summer break and he had no business, he didn't have a job at the guard, he didn't know how to do it again. And again, he got a little bit scared. Krista called the guard teacher Jani, and said, oh, this is it, Jani just for their sake, went to the summer vacation, and to my surprise, the dog could do the job again. But this is not the point of the story, but that on a Budapest big performance, on a November big performance in Budapest three years ago. He said he heard that his dog was taken to the hospital and that he came because Leslie was killed last month. But the dog lived more than 12 years. The dog was almost 13 years old. He was not cured, he was carrying his problems with him, but he was in good condition, in good condition for a long time. So he did a lot to make the dog in good condition. Well, please, that's all we've done for the dog, so with high temperature control, with the control of the owner, don't forget that. There's only one problem with that. I don't know if you noticed that when my dog is really motivated, so that he really wants to put something on, a cat pops up and he runs in front of it, then it's not that easy to direct. Did you notice? Do you have this? How not? Yes, because there is, and there is nothing to do about it, there is to make do about it, it is about getting a life-form program that is effective, where you first have to get the dog's control. This is usually done towards the end of a medium-sized learning process. I urge everyone to get this far, but you don't have to hesitate. I'll give you a tip, just so you understand the philosophy. I grab the dog's neck, I throw a ball ball, of course, this is a ball dog, if it's not a ball, then something else, let's say I fill a dummy with cheese, or I fill a little bag with cheese, but if I pull out a ball, I grab the neck, stay, I push it out, stay, bring it. And if you can do this, then you stay a little bigger, one ball, two balls, three balls. Hmmm, bring that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that Any dog sport, dog activity can be a very good lifestyle program. I recommend all of them to you. Do the most possible for your dog's health. I'm going to go and I hope to see you at some of the lifestyle programs. Please, now I would like to move on to the teaching, to the second section. We have to look a little bit here to understand the dog. What happens in the case of teaching? Well, please, what happens in the case of teaching, and this is a very interesting situation, is that two beings meet together, and the two beings have a different, the ancient word-love. We talk differently, the human speaks differently, and the dog speaks differently. It is different, our genetic word-love. Just pay attention. I meet together as a human, Géza, my friend. Hello, Géza, what meet up with my friend Géza as a human being. Hello, Géza, how are you? I tell him without thinking about it, selflessly, with a broken arm, that I'm getting closer to you with friendship, I have no bad intentions, I'm not hiding anything, I don't have a weapon. This is what human communication means. Pay attention to the dog, what does it mean? The same sign, pay attention. This is what human communication means. Look at the dog, what does it mean? The same sign, look at it. Look, how big I am, I'm scared of you. Hop! The same sign, it has a completely opposite sign. The dog has no easy job. Pay attention to the typical situation in the park. The puppy barks at the little girl, and she gets scared of the little girl. Go away, go away, I'm afraid of you, go away! The little girl is reflecting on this. No, little girl, don't be afraid of me, says the little girl. What if the puppy barks? You little girl, I'm very sorry, the dog has no easy job. But, but, it will soon be clear why we have the dog with us, dear lady, dear sir. During the evolution of the turtle, different species developed different super abilities, which, thanks to them helped them survive the challenges. The owl can see well at night, and can hunt in the dark. The chameleon, if I put it here, it's white and blue, if I put it there, it's brick-colored. This is what the chameleon, the mimicry, knows. What does the dog's ancestor, the wolf, know? What is its super power? What does the wolf know about its own super ability? What does the dog know about its own super ability? What does the dog know about its own super ability? What does the dog know about its own super ability? The smell is very good, but it is not the super ability. The smell is very good, but it is not the super ability. The smell is very good, but it is not the super ability. There is something that is a little different from the smell of animals. There is something that is a little different from the smell of animals. There is something that knows a little more than other animals. Something that knows a little more than other animals. Something that knows a little more than other animals. Something that knows a little more than other animals. Please, I just had to say this and they cut it right away. That's right, social skills, cooperation in the flock. This is what the wolf knows. A incredibly good communicator. You can communicate very well. If you can communicate very well, then the dog has inherited this, or inherited it, not just that. hermit, or a hermit, not just any way. The dog certainly overcomes the wolf, not even a little bit. The dog is already a super social, a super communicative being, but let's look at the difference between the wolf and the dog. Who does the wolf usually talk to? With the other wolf dog. Who else? Well, the one-sided communication with Nyuszi. We used to call it non-communication. Let's stay with the dog. The dog talks to the dog. The dog jumps from here. Help me, who does the dog usually talk to? With another dog? With a human? With a cat? With a fox? With a horse? With a dog? With a dog? Practically all living creatures can be languages in a completely unique way. Just think about it, what can I do? The dog can raise a Russian and a Tengri. Amazing knowledge. No one else can do it. Obviously, life is limited to the limits of life, because the golden age and dog friendship are not very much of a story. But, but, but... The dog is a communication genius, a language genius. He doesn't know these languages ​​at birth, but he learns them. And that's why the dog is with us, because he is able to learn human language first, and he understands that when they say, oh, my little dog, this is how I go home, they don't say, well, now they're going to get me in the brain. And when he goes down to the park and talks, he says, hey, you, you too, such a guy, what a guy, interesting. I think he has such a good head, because the dog has a really good head. He is brave enough to say that we talk to him in such a way. Well, please, to put this in a little context. It is worth highlighting how I can call the dog. I can give information in three ways. Help me, what are the three ways I can give information to the dog? Is there a body language? What else? My voice is very good. And I have facial expressions. These are the three. What am I usually most powerful in? Well, in speech, right? As you can see, I talk a lot here. It's very interesting, because for us humans, this is really our main communication area for us humans. But imagine that in the case of a dog, this is not the case. When we pass information to the dog, the information is amazing, but 70% is body language. And all in all, only 20% of face is the face. And yes, 10% of the voice is left. That's why it's important to understand and know, because when we talk to the dog, when we call the dog, then first of all our body speaks what it speaks to, but we are not conscious of it. That's why it's hard for us to teach the dog. that's why it's hard to give information to the dog. We used to say that it's a continuous, diagonal, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, knuckle, There are many modern techniques, but dear everyone, the moment has come when we can handle teaching in a decent way. Practically, the mirror method tells the teacher that no force should be applied to the teacher. We invite the dog to a conversation, an interaction, where he also practically takes part as a equal partner in the case of teaching. And we will learn a language for this, and this language is no different than the language of Clicker. This is what we will work with. I have worked with many teaching techniques, and I can say with confidence that I consider this the most effective teaching technique. It is not by chance that the mirror method is not the only one. What does this clicker mean? First of all, you have to understand that this is not a new language, neither for the person nor for the dog. We all have to learn this. Imagine, I go out into the park and I hear a green dog click. He says, don't touch me, just tell me. It's going to bother him enough. We have to build this clicker, the dog has to learn it, and so do I. And this is the key to the success of teaching. We both step towards each other. We both step towards each other. This is how learning becomes effective. And how does the clicker work? I would like to give you a little help with this now. Dear everyone, this is a camera. This is a camera. I'm photographing the given moment with it. And what does it mean? I usually make a photo on every show, and if I could, I would make a group photo now. I need your help. I would like to ask you to be kind to everyone to take pictures. And I'll burn the machine from there, and the picture will be taken in a moment. I would like to see the photo taken by everyone. From everyone. From everyone. Ah, that was a great joy. I did it, sorry, I turned on the smiley sensor. I promise one last thing, no matter what this last one will be, I would like to see the group picture again, the integration. Oh, this is true, I already put it in my pocket, in my photo album. The dog does exactly the same thing, but where will he store this picture? In his mind, he will store it in his mind. Well, I'm asking you how I can use this every day. Just be careful. What I'm telling you is of course the most basic version of the Click-Buy lesson, but the rest is built on this. Because then the starry sky is at the limit. Be careful, I'm out in the park. It would be so nice to teach my dog Bobby to sit down, because the neighbor's dog is used to it, but it would be nice for Bobby to run, Louis Vizsla, when he goes home, Bobby, oh, I'm so bored, there's no one here, oh, there's no one here, he comes to me, you're here, oh, he sits down. And I'm so happy that he sits down that I immediately take a picture of him. And of course I call him to the table, I give him the salad, he eats it. And what does the simple dog do after that? I took a picture, he ate the salad. What does he do after that? What does he do? He just says what he hasn't heard yet. What does he do? What does he do? He barks. Well, no one had a simple dog yet. What are you doing? He's going to kill me. Nobody had a simple dog yet. Everybody was just working with a little thing. He eats the bread and runs away. This is the Mellow. But there's nothing wrong with that. Next thing, again, Luisi leaves, Bobby, I'm here, here, here, photo, and he's gone, he's gone. I'm like, oh, I used to take photos of him. Look, you take another photo and sit down and how can I not take a photo of him right away? But now I'm sitting next to him and I'm taking photos like that. I'm sitting and I'm taking photos like that. Then after a while, I try to tell him the word of the word of the word. I sit, he doesn't sit down, then I sit down like this. If he sits down, I take pictures and give the wall to him. If he sits down ten times from ten to the word of the word of the word, then I have practically taught him the sitting exercise. There is only one thing left, what do I think, what can be left? To be ready. I throw away the clicker. And this is also an important moment, dear, dear everyone. This is a teaching tool. That is, not the dog's remote control. This is for teaching a practice, and then I take it out of it. Of course, you can repeat it from time to time, you can strengthen it, but I won't do it until the end of my life. Neighbor, let's move here, okay? So you don't have to use this until it Bila? So this is not the end of the story, until I teach you. So in Hungarian, once again, this is a teaching tool, not a dog guide. If you experience that somewhere, if you experience that, if someone uses the clicker like this, that Buksi, comeucsi, come here, then the lady or the gentleman will be sure that the clicker is not clear. Well, please, whoever gets this right, whoever starts on this road, can be shot down like a rocket, because we have incredible adventures ahead of us. I know it's hard, I know you have to be excited at the beginning, that clicker, my food, it's better, I know you have to taste it at the beginning, that it's spicy, it's a bit too much, it's not tasty, ugh! At the beginning, it's a bit too much, but it's worth it. I promise. Everyone, don't worry about it, I promise. It's a very effective teaching technique, and it's also good an old school, but it was such a frenetic discovery, catharsis, when we saw and experienced how the click works, so we quickly brought it to Hungary and distributed it, we gave books out, etc. We highly recommend it to you. Do it, do it, try it. Well, please, this was the lesson. And so towards the end of the lesson, a question, it is very important that some of you have already been on my show, please help me now not to spoil the questions, let's leave the rhetorical, well, how should I say, a little delicacies in that. I have a question for you. You have to teach the dog to come here when I tell him to come to me. Because he doesn't come here. You've probably seen a dog like this, haven't you? You have to teach this dog. I ask for your answer. Now, do you have to teach this dog? Do I ask for an answer? Now, yes or no? Yes or no? How can I not come here? It's totally logical that I have to teach him, right? Still, it was true who said that he doesn't have to teach. Smart ass. He doesn't come here. So what? Well, please, this won't be good. I apologize in advance, but why doesn't the next dog come here? In the park. Bobi, come with me! He looks back, he called me, or he didn't even look back. He sees that the neighbor's a funny guy, he says, look, brother, I can't stand it anymore. Listen, call the guys, I'll tell them to go home, okay? He looked at me, called me, saw that I was very, very, very confident, we're going to be a band at night, but how am I supposed to tell them when we're going home? Compared to that, at night, I had my violin in my hand, at 8 p.m., and I said, the bell rang, and they were say, Where is the lock? Have you experienced this? It's interesting to live at home. No? No? Then why don't you come in? Why don't you come in? You're joking. Why? Well, please, because I miss the sight. This is the sad situation. This is the sad next question. My dog barks with other dogs in my presence. You've probably seen this before. You have to teach them not to bark. Now I won't be able to beat you again. You don't have to teach them, but smart ass. Fighting? Then what? Well, I'm sorry, I won't like this either. Just watch. Dobbelman. A real warrior, strong acerism. Rottweiler, DAAAR! The bulldozer, all of them, they leave the home and take their owners for a walk. And they go, go, go, and once they meet, they are facing each other. Then both of them are crushed by the red flag is How many dogs are there? Bobby, let's go over there! For some reason, it doesn't make sense that I... And somehow, why, right? Remember? 70%? What do you say about 90%? Tuti, I won't be able to stop the conversation? But, simply... It doesn't make sense that I will stop the conversation. At this moment, the genetic command is switched on. If there is no boss, then he has to order. Well, he says, okay, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm everyone, if I could explain to the dog that I don't have to protect it, then it would not get angry in my presence. It would be very good to illustrate this with an example. If they let me do it, I won't do it because I don't want to waste time. But I recommend you to watch the part of the Noé-based episode of the series called One Dog, One Man. What happens there? You know what? I'll tell you, they cut it out. So, they know these shows, they don't know that the smart egg goes, it goes, you do it, you fly like Superman. These are such weird shows. This is also a ... Uh, I said something wrong to the old ones up there. I didn't want to say anything wrong. Can I continue? This was also a show like this. And I think we went towards the middle of the second year, Noé Animal Hospital Foundation, one of the country's most experienced, largest animal protection organization. We arrived, it was a good little high-tech show on TV2, I really liked it, the staff arrives with two microbus, it wasn't cheap either, it was around a million for a production of a show, we arrived, the staff came out, okay, but what can you do with your tongue? What can you do with it? What can you say? And then, look, bring your most aggressive dogs here. They brought these fucking keys. This is the 600-700 main... ...the main... ...the main choice. These real, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, The American with 75 kilos came and said, Bwaah! The 6-year-old munchkin mix! It's not good! Four of these! Four of these shitty dog breeds! I remember seeing them, the taste drop was all the way on my back. Then he said, Guys, we're not shooting today, sorry. Okay, good. The next story, let's watch. We started. We started. I asked all the dogs,. We left. We left. I asked all the dogs, one by one, and then they google it. It's worth it. So this is really worth it. I asked all the dogs, I introduced them to one dog. I told them a walker's guide, I'm directing them, brother, look there. All four of them separately. Then I put them together with two dogs. Then at the end, and I turned it around so that everyone could see it, then at the end, the four shittes together. Be careful, be careful, I'm asking everyone to understand this now. I'm not talking about when the little... Jabja Dóly, look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, look! And the piglet suddenly gets stuck in the fence. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey One out of four dogs allowed in. They can end it real time, so it took about this much time. So Ali was very little away from it, because it was Matini's time and TV2 said, well, kids, and so on. So when the 75-kilo American bulldog wanted to go, you're sure to direct it? That part was cut out a couple of seconds later. Okay, so just four dogs in there. Now, I'm not saying they were circling the stars together. Or that Buddha would have flown about a meter and a half above the track. So the bully looks like this. Watch out, watch out, watch out. And yes, and yes, I watched as much as I could, and never ever. And this is fine, for the first time. Half a year later, the lightning strikes and it's stupid, but in the beginning, that's all I know. What's the point? If the dog assumes that I can make decisions, if the dog is clean, etc., then it will give me the control. This is why everyone is so important and kind, because today, when the dog comes into the human family, we often get confused, we often get confused by the fact that we think that it is good for the dog to be left alone and to be petrified. If we leave everything to the dog, the dog does not see that I can make decisions, then a genetic program, as I mentioned, turns on and starts making decisions. This is a stressful situation, the dog is sick of stress and the dog is in a uncomfortable situation. I am the responsible owner, the dog would not want anything better than the owner to be able to make decisions. This is what we have, this is what we expect. Dear everyone dear and kind everyone, we have arrived at the point of holding hands, at the moment of the ritual, at the third stage, which is what I would really like to talk about with you. But to get deeper, we have to look a little bit at who the dog is. If you let me, I will talk about this now, but I have to drink a glass of water. I have to drink some water. So, now I'm going to talk about who the dog is. Well, first of all, I have to start with the dog being a two-person creature. This is a strange place. I'm sure you have this two-person creature. There is one at home, when he is crouching in the chair and he is sleeping like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like sleeping, and he is like this, and he is like this, and he is like this. And I go to the apartment, and wherever I go, he looks at me like this. He doesn't take his smart eyes off me. I'm serious, Gábor, he has more hair than my husband. What is it? What is it? Would this be the dog? Yes. Yes, this is one of the creatures of the dog. The creature that I created as a human being, where the intellect is out of control. This exists, this exists in the dog. But there is the other one. I don't know if you noticed, when but when they leave the house, they open the door. And then they don't always look at me. Did you notice? Did you notice? They don't always let me in. I go out into the park, I let them in. And I don't even look at them with my eyes wide open. Do you know this? Do you know? And wait, wait, wait. Who am I going to? Who am I going to? Forest. Forest. I'm going to the forest. Where did I come from? Where did I come from? I'm going to the forest. I'm going to the forest. I'm going to the forest. I'm going to the forest. I'm going to the forest. I'm going to the forest. From there, the number 5, the number 8, the number 6, the number 3, the number 4, the number 3, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the number 4, the He doesn't even look at me there anymore. The devil moves in. I run there quickly, I smoke, I go home, I go to the door, I smoke, I die, I'm the stupid dog in the forest, I'm not normal. Who is this miracle? What miracle? Is this the dog? Is this the dog! This is the dog! This is the dog's instinct. If you like it, if not, it will still rumble in our dogs. Indeed, the strong instinct of the dog. Exceptions without exception, maybe the Jorssi Terrier is the only exception, but in all other dogs, other dog in the world. The real joy is an exception. There is the feeling that I open the door and someone looks out and says, Oh, it's raining, but I'm going out. Or I take it out to the park, put it down and it stops. And if I don't give it food, then after a while he'll starve to death. I hope this can be said in the Mamut Business Center. This can be said. I say this. It happened at the Mamut Business Center that I met a lady, I saw her, she wanted a little york, and she walked here. And another lady came to me and then, oh, but it's a little york, what What? That there is no breed in the Yorkshire Terrier? How can it be in its nest? Please look at all the Yorkian properties now. I love the Yorkshire Terrier. It's a tough breed. I'm the one who's pushing it. Which is not good. If I don't take care of the breed of the dog, then I don't respect the dog. Then I don't respect the dog. Then I don't respect the dog. Do I really love the dog? Then the pet is included. I need to know, I need to know who the hell is the pet. And now I would like to talk a little bit about who this pet is with a strange example. This is a strange example. 30 Mayons live in cleanliness, we call the leader 1, and the Mayan baby born yesterday is 30, a stream flows through the Tisztás, a stream, a broken tree can only be crossed, and one Mayan simply gets on the bridge. What happens if the 1st and, say, the 25th want to cross the bridge? Well, I'm asking you, the most likely thing that will happen is that the 25th will say that the bridge. I'm asking you, what will happen? He says he will be with someone and then he will run away in a flash. What does this chief do? Did you see? Did you see? This is the question. He is satisfied to see that he has received the respect he deserves. Okay. Meeting of the 1st and the 15th. They approach the bridge. The 15th notices that the boss is coming in, and at that moment he runs away. Just like the 25th, but not Visi. What does the boss do to him? Well, yes, I'm still from the 15th. He is quite calm that I got it for them. Or he says, he's running away, but he's not cheating. Then he runs away, he's going to hide it, so he can The sixth is already a someone, an aristocrat. He's already a member of the team. They approach the church, they notice each other, and at this moment, the sixth thinks, I have a banana somewhere here, I remember, I put it here, and he goes to see where he put his banana. This is what happens, the first and second floor. The mayor goes through, the sixth one comes back later, and if there is no one, he goes through. And this is very familiar to me. This is very familiar. Just pay attention. In the park. In the park. Bobby, come here! Bobby! And Bobby, come here! Bobi! And Bobi, come here! Bobi, I'm coming, I'm coming! Have you ever seen this? When I call the dog and it starts barking? Very rarely, but there are such cases. Come on, Bobi, come on, I'm coming! Come on, Bobi, come on! What a lucky dog I am! This is the first and sixth reason. It looks for the dog, he's looking for his banana. Hoppa, hoppa. Well, that's in there, too, that's possible, but the smell is the most common, the smell is sometimes the most common, the smell is sometimes the most common, but... Let's see, let's see what's next. The next meeting is the first and the second meeting. The most obvious of the two is the hierarchy war. They approach the bridge. They see each other. And at this moment, they both think, there's banana somewhere here. I remember putting it here. They both go to look for the banana and then they come back separately at a later time and cross the bridge. And this is also very familiar to me. Pay attention, you've probably seen this before, it's rare, but you've probably seen this before. I go out into the park, I call my dog Bobby. Bobby, come with me! Bobby starts to bark, or not. Bobby, come on! He didn't come, he got used to it. Bobby, come on! Bobby, come on! I want to pet you! I'll burn you, little girl! I'll explain why the dog doesn't come in. Have you ever met a dog like this? Very rarely, but I've met one before. I'll explain why the dog doesn't come in. I'm looking for my banana. This is the relationship between the first and the second. Indeed, few people understand this precisely, this needs to be looked at a little bit behind. What is the biggest crime that a dog can commit against its owner? The biggest crime. Help me. What? Disrespect? I'm not kicking you, not even then. What's the biggest crime? Open aggression against the owner. This is the biggest crime. Now I would like to ask you if you have ever seen a dog attack its owner. Have you seen it? Did you see Bigl attack his owner? Did you see? Bigl, do you know this yellow, brown, white, this legendary dog that knows how to respect? Because the owner never attacks, right? And that's why you're not a dog that knows how to respect? Really? How can Bigl ownersagle owners on the street? Léci, take it! Thank you! Take it! Do you have it? Do you have it? When I buy a Beagle, I get a sign next to it, from the shopkeeper, Léci, take it! Léci, take it! This is how it is written. Okay. They say that the Beagle is a stupid dog. Stupid dog? Well, whoever says this about the Beagle, has no idea what the Beagle is. The Beagle, please, is one of the smartest dogs! Just think about it, that he uses his many, many teeth to eat his prey. Yeah, and he succeeds. This is the big deal. A very smart dog, and not the one that works together. And fanatical. Please, the biggest crime that a dog has committed, is to be openly addressed to the owner, but left with a tail, a tail, practically almost equal, what? What? The demand is found. Yes. This is the biggest crime. So when I hear this, that Gábor, this is a very good car, it's nothing, it always comes in, but it's nothing. It's almost like looking at what kind of car you have, wow, this is very good, but let's say it doesn't have a motor. If I can't call the dog, then our relationship is in its core. When you can't call the dog in the park, it's about, actually it's even bigger, but I'm going to be very serious now, you have to burn a picture in their heads. It's like a child's head is being fed by a child's head. So the closest thing is when you call your dog and he can't come in, then let him feel this sticky, stinging food. This is what happens. This is the disrespect we experience with the dog. If you like it, if not, then this is it. Yes, and we must first see that this is the dog's respect. What do you think is needed to make sure that my bigleys don't get lost? Help me, because based on the example I told you about, based on the example of the 30 million, what is needed? Relative management. I think they usually say that the alpha should be the leader. Okay, I am the alpha. It's not that easy to be an alpha, thank God I don't even have to, but now let's say I'm the first, next to me, next to me, Rotweiler is the second, this didn't come in. But the good news is that I might be the third, fourth, fifth, if, and they said it right there, if, dog is 18 or 25 years old, and you know what the Marhajó Bridge is, and it's very important, that the whole family can fit in here. The whole family can fit in. Grandson, little boy, little girl,, a mother, everyone can fit in. They say that a farm dog is not. The question is who can cover this distance. The dog asks us to prove that we really have a sight, because here the distance actually means a sight. And do you know what the good news is about the dog? That I don't have to be an alpha. I don't have to be a leader of the flock. Why? Why good news? Well, please, I have to look at this a little bit, but before I look at what's with this flock, I'd like to talk to you about something before that. There was once, there was that moment once everything was fine with my dog. Perfect. There was a distance. I was almost there. I remember when I took a dog home. Do you remember the first days? When I took it home, I went out to the park, put my shoes on, and then I woke up and I was like, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Where did it fall? What happened? Where did we fall? When did it fall? Does anyone remember? No? Well, on the 30th walk. Do you remember the 30th walk? No one else? Well, I'll tell you, okay? First walk, one step, fifth walk, five steps, you went from me, tenth, tenth, thirtieth walk, one step, fifth walk, five steps, ten, ten, thirty, thirty steps. And on the thirtyth walk we met the... The Worm. Worm. Do you know the Worm? It had a red-brown fur. Huge ears. Throbs and eyes. And Bobby ran to the food truck. Hi, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you At this moment, panic was on my mind. Listen to this! Bobby, come here! Come here! Bobby, come here! The boss is calling! Jesus Christ! I believed that the boss was here! Holy shit! Do you remember? The information is 70% 20 percent, 90 percent. What did I say to my dog now? Oh, I'm in trouble. With this step, I have fulfilled my loser rule. I, Gábor Korom, swear that I am not suitable for the direction of my dog Bobby. First note, first stamp. And I handed it over to him. This is the situation. There and then I filled it out. What should I have done to not fill out the loser's ID card? Help me, what should I have done? What? What should I have done? Tell me a tip. I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have been there, I should have a tip! You should have been there, I'll give you a kiss on the dog's head. Now, a little bit, they'll be careful, they'll put their ears in, let them watch, I'll kiss you there. There, there, Bomi, come here! Did you see how much I kissed? Did you see? There was the solution. You should have turned in the opposite direction. I had to do this. Maybe it was like this, I was in the corner, Bobby come here, Bobby. This is not the real thing, is it? I was in the corner with my body. But I ruined it there and then. But the situation is that there is that moment when you have to fill the loser. Everyone, me too, everyone fills the loser's account. Let's say, I just ran out to the main road, the car is coming, me and Bobby are with me, I take the phone from the front, say hello, hello, a new car is coming, oh no, just smile on the road. Who cares? Oh, I got caught, let me go, I'm a little stupid. This has to be filled. This is fine. To spend. The problem is not that I filled it out once, because there is that situation when. Do you know what the problem is? That I have been spending this Luzer-reasoning so often every day, but it's so... Just pay attention! Bobby, with my consequences, the power... Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, you can't come, Bobby, you Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, loser rule forward, a new Hungarian lexicon, seven examples, six already filled in, the seventh is at the end. I'm pressing like this, I'm pressing like this. Well, please, now we're going to start and we're going to start cleaning up this loser rule, we're going to start building our relationship, but I promise that I would like to talk about this dog. I would like to ask you, or rather, put it on the table, do you think the dog wants to live in a dog's skin? Raise your hand if you think so. Yes, they did. So many of them have said it. Thank you. What is this fox? Oh, the fox, the foxes, together, for each other. And when the sun rises, they say hello to the fox together. Hello fox, hello fox, the sun-kissers together. Right? This is the fox. Well, I'm a little bit confused. What is the fox! Well, what is the fox? If I live in a fox, my dog will look like this. I come home at 8 in the evening, I open the door, Damn it! What is this? And the children say, Dad is coming home, he will leave at 8 in the morning, let's get out of here, let's get out of here! This would be the fox! This is what a fox would be like. This is what a fox would be like. Now I would like to ask you again, who do you think likes to live in a fox's cage? Raise your hand. Oh, two gentlemen raised their hands. Good. And a lady too. They are right. Imagine. They are right. The dog likes and can live in the flock. Who doesn't love to live in the flock? We, the people. Thank God, and I hope that those who don't want to live in the flock will come here. Because I could end my presentation here. I could close ended my presentation here. I could have closed it here. And I would have said, thank you for coming. You are not living there from now on. And I would have killed you. And I was right. But we are not the only ones. Thank God we are developing. Thank God, thank God, our system has shot itself out and we live in a family. And you know what the good news is? That the dog can love to live in its flock, but at least as much as it loves, if not better, and can live in a family. What is the difference between the flock and the family? Who makes the decision in the family? The leader of the family, the alpha, makes the decision. The alpha always makes the decision. He is the one who makes the decision. Who makes the decision in the family? We stay so much that the decision areas are divided in the family, and there is no problem until we get through this. Until then the family works very well. But from the moment I step over my own decision-making competencies, from that moment on, from that moment on, I'm in trouble. If my 10-year-old daughter says, I'm not going home, I'm just going to bed at 2, you can't do this. The family falls apart. I go home, I see a crazy motorbike, in throw it in my pocket, I run there, I run home, I get stuck. Dearly so. We don't eat at home, but we have such a motorbike, I can't stand it. The family falls apart. And if it's not a sheep, nor a family, then comes the third form of coexistence that we would like to get rid of, this is nothing more than the fence. What is the fence? The fence is when the Christians put the Melos in Jerusalem, because we don't need it anymore, they put them on the cross, and wherever they went, wherever they went, they went to all the abandoned villages, demographically destroyed, etc. Who makes the decision in the herd? Who? The one who is closest! The herd is a non-long-term order of life, built on the When the owner is wagging the dog, it is also a dog. We want to get rid of these, we want to live in a family with the dog. The mission of the mirror method is to be able to live in a family with the dog. Well, please, we arrived here then, but how? Hahaha, dear, dear everyone! We had three pillars, right? Teaching, relationship and lifestyle. And within the relationship, there is a third division. This is no other than the three virtues of the dominant unit. We can measure this and improve our relationship with this. Pay attention, the dominant unit will have three virtues. Here we have to understand that the dog is... Do you remember? I said in the lesson that we both take one step towards each other. In the relationship, I learn to speak the dog language. And we have a master who speaks this dog language very well. I'm sure you know him. They call him the... ...Pastor. Do you remember when the pastor walks on the porch? Do you remember when the pastor walked on the porch? Do you remember? Thank God, because if he had, he wouldn't have to wear a mask, because our civilization is so poor. So the pastor doesn't even know the concept of the porch. He has the ability to act. He only has one problem with it, that he says, Bátya Bátya, how do you do this? He calls the dog and asks him how to, Buddy, how do you do this? He calls the dog and asks him to come over. How does he do it? Oh. I told him, come here. Brother. So he knows, but this is a conscious knowledge. Our age asks for more than that. So we want to understand what it is all about. The three main requirements of the dominant system are that it understands, explains, and explains to us what and how the relationship between man and dog works. We learn to speak in dog language. We are looking for communication techniques that the dog will live with. I'll give you an example. You've probably seen that the dog marks the walking area in the middle of the walk. Have you seen this? It gives you dominant signals. It Mark the walking area! I've been telling him this all along. He should pay attention. From now on, if they walk, I'll follow them and mark all the signs. Try it! Many people don't like my idea. Well, please, please, the situation is that although the technology works, there are people who tried it. I don't. Because the technology works, I don't recommend it to you, I don't recommend it specifically. And not because it doesn't work, but because the leaders of the outside world say, you, this is Hungary, I don't think you should go there. Let's not do this. Let's not do this. We are looking for the techniques that fit into our moral, moral system. Now, these are the three main requirements. Let me tell you what I'm talking about. The first is the border of private areas. Second, this is my job. Third, the direction of joint action. So, the border of private areas, this is my job, the direction of joint action. Let's start with the border of private areas. Every living being has a personal space, and we don't like it if they enter our personal space. We don't like it, it's not good for us. The more dominant someone is, the more they can enter the other person's personal space, the less dominant they are, the more they have to break free. And this dynamic changes as well, so it's not static, it's completely different when two bedouins meet in the bushes, one is 150 meters away from the other, and they shoot down the tree. Compared to the morning high-speed traffic on the bus, it's like a Frenchman eating a lamb. You see, now that I'm holding the show, it's a strange situation that I'm on stage, usually we look for places where we don't have to be on stage, but here too, they must have noticed that sometimes I come out here, but then I step back, that I don't like the people sitting in the front row. Because if I were to come down here from the front, and I would be gesturing from here, then it would be unpleasant for the people sitting in the front row. After a while, they would feel bad about themselves. But if I were to come here, and I would be gesturing from here, and I would be telling myself here, I would get such a scolding from the Lord that I would go back quickly. In a minute I would have been so angry with the Lord or the lady, because it was an unrespectful self-respect, I ask for your attention. I couldn't stand it, I entered your private space, I can't do this, I can't step in. This is the private area. Let's see how it actually looks at the Farkas Falka. How does this private area look like? He goes hunting, he goes back to the Alfa's private sport, private hunting, and he steps in. Have you seen this in a natural film, how it looks like? He steps in, and as soon as he walks in, he immediately checks the team. Is everything okay with you? Did you eat? Did you eat? Don't be silly, is everyone okay? He immediately checks the team to see if everything was okay. Do you have it? Do you remember? No? Don't you watch natural films? Do you just watch series? No? Don't they watch nature movies? Just like to watch series of them? No? Of course not! Of course not! Well, this is not how it looks at all! We are not accidentally getting tired of it. This is how it really looks. The alpha walks into the cleaning and the others come forward to greet him. Greet him, give him 100 seconds, etc. etc. This alpha kindly... ...stops him. He disturbs them, get out of the way, disturb them. Then they will be put down, then they will be put down. They will be put down. The 25th once just says, you, listen, I want to say that, listen, that, what a wonder, there is no need for the 25th to go to the 1st. Max is asking for it. Sir, let me go there. You don't even want to look at it? Let me go there. Léci, look, how greedy I am. Look. And when can I go in? When can I go in? Then, of course. When you get permission. Then you can go in? When you get permission! Exactly! Just like at home. Please pay attention! What is coming up now is a good advice. I will tell you tips and techniques. My good news is that you don't have to practice this. There is no need for this. If your relationship with the dog is fine, then these tricks, these exercises, these domination exercises. If you are not in good shape yet, then I recommend you to practice them. And to quickly realize whether you need it or not, I will quickly throw you a test that we are doing in our heads right now. We are almost done, please pay attention, I will tell you the test. If you can call your dog in the park from the playing child, from the ball, from the big dog, from the dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from the big dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, from a dog, through the private area. Let's see. We talked about how the alpha arrives home with the bear. How do you do a dominance exercise from this when I get home? The... There's work... The leader, the private sportsman, the work, he comes home at 6 p.m. I haven't seen him for 10 hours, 9-10 hours, I haven't seen him for 10 hours. I walk in. Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, wait a little bit, wait a little bit. Okay. I'll say it again, if you don't have a problem with the dog, then there's no problem with coming home like this. But if the relationship hasn't really cleared up yet, then the thing that needs to be strengthened is that I come home, It was 6 in the evening, but in the morning... In the morning... I spent an hour and a half... Now! Shut up! Shut up! And when I see him, I say, what's wrong with you? Why are you acting like this? So he gave up his intention to break into my private space, then I can say, let him go. Let it go! And the puppy is coming! Because the problem is not with the puppy, it's not with the dog sleeping in the hotel, but with the dog not having the control ability. So, this would be my first suggestion, and maybe we can practice this... I'm going to steal this... We have a practice that we usually which we usually give at a basic level of learning, that we sit down, I put the chair down on a carpet, I sit down on the chair and I do not let the dog up on the carpet. Go down, listen, go down, Gábor, no, do that. Go away. Please, go away. Don't you understand? We have to realize this. This was the border of private areas. When is there a problem? When I can't set it up. And when there is a very big problem? When he sets it up with me. I start work in the morning, I when he gets up in the morning, I go to work at 8 in the morning, Kutus is sleeping, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go tomorrow, oh, oh, oh, what a miracle, what and that, and start collecting the stuff. A torn hi-fi, a torn sofa. Good that Gábor Kámar is here, the stupid dog, three cakes in here. And when this box is full, let me be careful, then, and it's still wrinkled, I can't even talk, I sit down on the sofa and wait for the little dog to try to come to me. And wait! I wait with endless patience, that if he comes here, I will put my box of contents on him. And when the dog comes, I tell him, get out of here, the dog is here! I put my box on the table. Do you remember what happened to the 90%? Did you see that? Be careful, this technique is not compatible with when I go home, I see that the little dog opened the fridge, and I put the pot here, and he still puts it out, Gábor. I put the Get out of here, you idiot! Do you feel the difference? You do? Well, that's it. I'm not kidding, that's it. It's in one piece. What you've thought about, you feel it, and you realize it. The line of will, will, and will to think is connected. It's in one piece. Very... Well, don't... Don't... Get lost! It's very rare, but it's the first? Very often. Well, don't... Don't... ...dissolve yourself! Very rarely, but it's the first time this happens. Okay. Well, please, this was the border of private space. Let's move on to the next one. This is no different. This is my thing. Every living being has a self-sustaining activity, and we don't really like it if others are involved in it. The more dominant I am, the more I can do my own activity, the less I have to behave to make others get involved in my work. Let's see how this thing works, the tailed fox. By the way, we are interested in human cohabitation. There are things that the dog can't talk about. You know, there's this engine, this gasoline engine, you know, this damir. And my dog is coming to help me with the hose, I put it like this, the bag is empty, I don't believe it. We both want to do this alone and not help my dog. We both want this. Okay. Let's look at the wolf... Yes. Let's look at the wolf's tail. How do you look at my thing? What is the most intense activity of the wolf's tail? Help me, what? That is... The hunt! And how do you finish a well-made hunt? With food. Hunting! And how do you do a successful hunt? With food. I also ask for a napkin. Yes, yes, not the other napkin, it's already dirty. How do you do it? With a big... ...touch! Please. Please, please. So, so, they hide the and then the others. Like this. Okay. I would like to show you how this dominance looks like at the sheepfold. Pay attention. And again, you will need a little assistance. Play a little bit with the hungry, hungry sheep. I will show you what the alpha does at this time. We have hidden the The camera is rolling back to the Twitter screen. He really can't fit in anymore. What are you doing with the meat? What? He's giving it up, he's giving it up. Come on, come on. Just like at home. Pay attention! 8 PM, I'm preparing a dominance exercise. I have a grating veiling in my hand, with more and more fine gratings. Come on, come on, come on! Sit, sit, sit, sit! You're a genius! I was a domino! I told him to come down! This would be a dominance exercise? Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, You can't control yourself in this situation. Anyone who knows the dog knows. Now let's do a dominance exercise quickly. Pay attention. With the Weyling style, with the hungry dog style, but I don't sit down, I grab and put it down. And if they eat it, they'll say, thank you very much, it's a good point. Well, trust me, get out of here, get out! Then I grab myself, I push the, how are you? Well, I'll show you. Stand up here! Stand up! Then I'll grab myself, I'll put the dog in front of its mouth, I'll take out the fattest claws, and I'll start to bite them visually! Stand up here! Stand up here! If someone is a vega or this style doesn't come in, then luckily you can also make a house-holding keg. And that... Stand up here, who let you in? The expression, luckily, you can live well here. What did I say, who let you in? And again, I really lived well. And what do I do with the cheese? I leave it there, I leave it. Now you do it., this, this. What's the matter now? Now seriously? Is this why we came here, without a fight, and without a reason? That's why. I request an observation, if I want to make my relationship right, and I want to talk in the language of dog's instinct, then I have to get in here. Here I have to explain that I am able to make a decision. Like this. but by the intellectual, so even if I have passed the level of the pastor's consciousness, I already understand, it won't be easy, but I already understand what I want. Well, I ask you how effective this is. Now I will put in again, they will cut out the maximum TV show examples, I would put in an example again. It's not easy to watch, because it's not easy to reach the MTV show. This was Hungary's first dog magic TV show. It was run by Neveletlenek. Obviously everyone knows it. It was run by Neveletlenek. Do you know the MTV channel? Do you remember it? No one? Do you remember the MTV2 channel? Nobody? Well... How come? They made me watch it once after the weekend. How did you like it? Oh, you worked! They repeated it three times at dawn. Well, if not, then not. Okay. I really like this show. Well, it wasn't as high-tech as the other one, it was a little bit older, but it was a bit more gustous. I liked it. And I ask you, if you know, please follow this, if not, I'll tell you the story now, because it's a bomb story, this is the second best story I've ever had on a TV show. The first one I'll tell you quickly, just for fun, it was the worst. I've never seen anything like this before. I think we were in Soroksár on a dog walk, one dog was the other. Imagine that on this walk, when they came to the playground, they arrived at the far end of Hajdú, they arrived at the end of the world, because they were able to get there. And the dog got bored of the visitors, so they had to go home. They don't believe this, do they? I wouldn't believe it either, but it really was like this. Okay, I'm not going to talk about this now, about the two victims. Just a little bit left about this, keep an eye out. The next story, they called us, it was on the Pasa street, and the lady told us that there were two people who could never have let go of their hands, even in the church of the community house. They were never let go of their hands. And she asked for help from us. We entered the room, the lady opened the door and said, let them come quickly, so they don't escape. And then we quickly medifuned, a quarter of an hour passed by, we stopped with the stafibos, all the dog's hives. Okay, the picture comes back again, and we're talking inside, and they look at it, if they know, they google it somehow, or they look at it afterwards. And we started talking about the two of them, what's going on. And we just talked once, and the lady was a One of them, with a bagel, with four legs, maybe they were left behind because the cameraman was late, and he was still walking in front of us. He started to spit out the ham sandwich from the ham sandwich. I don't have to say it, it went into my trash can. So, okay. Then we sat down on the couch, I asked him to talk, and we talked, and the other one suddenly jumped up, one of my ears went in, the other one out, and then my box is already very full. And I ask the owner, because you really have to see the order, a rule in their hands, is there anything that is forbidden for dogs? Is there anything? They can't get into the net. Super! Now, this is the technique with which you should start a connection repair. And you ask, why is the network blocked? Well, you would go in separately. The total, the total, complete anarchy. Okay, here we go, here we go. And then, well, there's a technique called Japanese dinner, when I put two sandwiches on a tray, and I sit down, or the whole family sits down, we sit in a circle. So the Japanese dinner is when we put the bread on a tray, we sit down, the family eats the bread, the dog is two or three meters away, and he looks at us, and he says, Did you bake a cake? Did you bake it? I can hear you! And at the end, if you find the last one, I will throw it away. If not, then no. This is the Japanese dinner. This is a very good, very good, this is my thing, dominance practice technique. It's super good to build and improve relationships with it. Okay, so I asked the lady for a plate, and what do you think I put on the towel? Oh, I see, I already have some with me. That's right, I put on the ham sandwich and I put it on the ground nicely. Two flags, and if they can see this, look at this, because their faces are burning inside. Two flags are coming out. Let's see what happens. And I go there, the Sondkás Szent Dozé, I let them go there, they flammoat nicely, at that moment, at that moment, as soon as he, I saw a flash from here! This is the second flash. Now what's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Who are you? What's wrong? You're normal. Okay, I turned around. I flashed back again. I got in again. This is the content of my trash can that's still in me. It's falling. A flash from here! And look at this, the picture... Well, it's true. It exists. It's been thrown away. And from here on, the two of you didn't even look at me! You just looked at me! And we kept talking, but you were so rude! Boss, you were so rude! And the whole behind the scenes, when we were closing the conversation, maybe this is not in the show anymore, I really miss it. Do you remember? We could barely get in. At the reception, the entrance door opened, the garden door opened, the two of us were like, Stop it, talk to me, boss, don't leave me alone! And the host was all angry at you, wondering what's going on. I don't understand this, Gábor. I love them that way. Take care of them. Here's the trap. Remember, I told you the dog is a two-person creature. The animal itself, too. The intellectual being is easy to-person creature. The whole creature too. It is easy to find the intellectual creature, but the whole creature too. This is where the problem is. Well, please, this is my job. When is there a problem? This is my job. When is there a problem? If I can't set it up. When is there a very big problem? When is there a problem? When I can't set it up. When is there a big problem? When he sets it up in front of me, for example, I'll eat the cake, etc. This Japanese dinner technique can be used to build an incredibly effective relationship. And the third wish is left. We're actually closing with this. The third wish is none other the game. The third option is to control the game. The dominant option is to control and lead, and he closes the game. Let's see how this common action looks like in the case of the Red-Wings. The Red-Wings are resting, the leaders resting time, the team is in a loose game. Once, once, the leader gets up and... ...he is being pushed. The flag stops for a moment, he looks at the leader, well, well, something happened, well, the leader is lying back, oh, nothing happens anymore. No, the leader gets up, he starts to go towards the stream. Look, look, there might be something, the leader got up, we might go hunting, oh, nothing, they play on. No, the boss gets up, goes towards the stream. Look, look, there might be something, the boss got up, we can go hunting, look, look, look. Boss drinks, come on, come on, come on, he walks back, oh, they go down, oh, nothing. The games come back, no. The boss, after he called, goes towards the clean exit. And the team starts to smoke themselves in the barn at once. That's it! It was a fantastic experience, I was lucky to have it. And the team starts to burn themselves in the fire. It was a fantastic experience, I was lucky to have a partner. Let's go hunting! I hear you! Let's go hunting! Let's go hunting! Boss, who's going? Don't look back! Well, this is it! This is it! He left us here. And slowly, they calm down and return to the game. No! Before the boss steps out, and now let me pay attention pay attention, before the chief steps out, he sends out the signal to start the hunt, and at this moment the fire-fired cars are somehow going back to the shelter and are about to set out to hunt in the hunting lodge. The others are behind the chief him, behind him, in the sky. Just like at home. I sit on the couch, read a little book, and then I lie down next to my dog, I just snap my fingers and I just lift my head and he starts looking at me. Maybe there's something. No, I open it, I read more, Bobby, oh, in France, okay, then he lies down again to sleep. No, no, I put the book down, I get up and I look out. Bobby follows me, I won't show this. Bobby follows me. Oh, there's something. I go into the washroom. Oh, the front. I thought it was... He goes back to the room. He lies down. No. I go to the bathroom... Or to the front door. And Bobby goes, I knew it, I knew it, let's go. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well I have nine teeth! No! Before I step out, I'll give the sign to start hunting. I'll say, Elza! I'll hold my neck, Elza! I knew it! And I'll put it up, open the door, and the team will be arranged in a hunting formation. The chief will be next to me, the others will be in the background. Hello, Géza! I can't talk right now, you walked the dog. What am I doing? I never walked the dog. The dog calls me three times a day. Yes, please, now let's do a dominance exercise. Remember, the boss next to me. What am I going to ask the boss what I'm going to do next. The moment Bobby takes me in, I tell him, Brother Sajd, listen to me. I tell my body that it's not him who's in charge, but me. So what do I do? Help me. What do I say to my body? What do I do? I turn around. I signal that I'm in charge. And since he doesn't look at me, I turn around, I stumbling with my body. I don't know if they tried to make a back-to-back TV. Did they try? It's not worth trying. It's stupid. If the dog doesn't look at me, I'm just stumbling with my body. I'm telling him to look at me, and a dog that is like this, the dog is like a habit, he's like, tic-tac, you're on his side. I'm sure you're on his side. A this, even a bigger dog, boom, a bigger one too. Okay, and I'm leaving. Again, go ahead, again, bang. Okay. Very important. I'm in charge, behind me, behind me. The team members. And don't mix it up with the custom that has been around the world. Many, many millions of people every day. Because what is happening here now? I know what I want, I control it, I tell it what is happening. This is the practice, this is the step, step, step, what is happening here? I don't know what I want, but I would want to do this. Let's not mix this up, because my body communication is not clear here. This is very important. My body communication is not as clear as in the previous practice. And how incredibly effective this is, I would like to tell you now... Stay, Bovi. I would like to tell you a story now it's a living story, and I'm not quoting from a TV show. I could quote from many TV shows, for example, I introduced this technique with the help of the four Shittites of Kocsma. Do you remember? Now, not a TV show, but the first one that burned inside me, dear, kind everyone, happened in the early 90s, at the National Dog School, the main gangster of Hungary, my class knows that we lived in such a world back then, and he brought his legendary dog, Igor, the Russian imported Moscow-born dog. Igor was the first to hear the news. It was known that Tokostu had cut a concrete fence, and they were huge, 70-80 kg, amazing monsters. Igor was really a monster, a wonderful, healthy, huge dog. And he went to the gangster friend for a conversation, and he told him to watch out, I don't know who you are, but you're here solidly. And by the way, he was a heavy boxer, and he just told him friendly, and he kicked the biceps of the heavyweight boxer. Well, this is how Igor came up with. The problem was that he couldn't put it under the pillow, and he was all angry. The hostess said it would be nice to do something with him now. Okay, he opened the door and he was certainly looking around. So what's the problem now? In the 90s, if I didn't help, I could have a problem. Some of my dear colleagues remember that. That could be my problem. If I help, he'll know. I couldn't put a blanket on him. I asked the owner to put a blanket on my dog and start walking with it on the street. Then I slowly walked behind him, asked for the blanket, asked him to stay down to sit in the car. I just turned around and didn't touch the plumber. It was only a few minutes of body communication, and then after a few minutes, the 80kg monster was like this. And I started to get better and better. And then once, when Igor was sure he was going to win, the mother of all Russians, BAM! And again, BAM! That's when Igor was like, Finally, brother! I told you! I will never meet you again! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Once there was a dog-buying in Buda. I ask everyone with great respect to not ask for a dog from here to go home, to not ask for a dog from the Rottweilers, the Kaukázusik, the Moscow dogs, the Pórházs, and to show their newly acquired knowledge. I didn't do more. I overcame this, as the next slide shows, but I could have done worse. Igor recognized me, he recognized the owner. One such technique was enough. But this is now a part of the invitation left. I can say this freely, because then I can say it and close it with that, that's the end of this presentation. Can you hold on for a little bit, I'll ask you for another five minutes, I'll finish it in five minutes. If someone can't hold it, I I'll get out of the way. But if I let him say it quickly, I'll tell him before the second part. So, our relationship, our arrangement of relationships has to start on this road. This way we will be effective. We can measure our relationship with the three wishes, we can fix it, we can arrange our relationship. And we also understand that the call, which I think is the most important thing, the call, will also be arranged with the eye contact. But until we reach the call, or the eye contact, we still need a call for some tip. And now I would like to give you three tips that you should never do and one that you should definitely do. Let's look at the three things that you should never do during the call. The first one is the following. If you haven't been there for eight or ten hours, you come home, you run away, you let go, your friends start talking and then you're done. You're done. You're done. Come to me! And what happens to the command line? If you come to me, what do I do with you? I take you home. What would he like to do best? Run, fight with the others? Come to me! I hate to come to you! I hate to come to you! Be careful! You have to pay attention to the command line. in with the command, what do I do? I praise him nine times out of ten, and let him play again. And I'll only catch him once out of ten, so that his pleasant experiences are strengthened by the command. This is the first thing we do. Next, have you ever seen a dog that jumps around the owner for a meter and the owner can't get it? Have you seen it? I tell you how you can train your dog to do this. Two days. Two days and he's done. Pay attention. First day. Bomi, come here! He's done, he's done. Second day. Bomi, come here! Ah, he jumped into France. He's done. I've already taught him, I've already trained him. Watch out, don't get too close, here too, here too. Because he'll get it, and he learned it, and he jumps in turn. You have to train him like this quickly. Make sure they don't get the dog. But what do I do then? I don't know. Well, I'd like to do something, but he can't catch it. He grabs a stick, and he goes, come here, I'll give you a massage. Okay, and then I'll hold your neck like this. Okay, and then I'll hold your neck like this. But I won't get it after that. Pay close attention to that. Okay. Two things I don't do. And the third, the most important thing, which I would never do anything about! The hour and a half. Get him to me! And the dog... What? What? What? You're smart! Be careful, if a dog comes in, it's strictly forbidden to guard at this time. It's strictly forbidden, because it can cause such a harsh communication disorder, that it's very, very, very difficult to control it afterwards. I'm not saying that you should let him play again at this time, I'm not saying that you should not put this other thing in the bin. And let's say, if he goes home, let's say the little kid would forget who he is leading and who he is leading, and in case he would overtake, then our bin shouldn't be thrown out. He has a place there and he is right, but I only praise him here if comes in here. Anything has happened before. Well, not these. And then what? Dear ladies, dear gentlemen, today's most important good advice is coming and I ask everyone to accept it. The bond. What does it mean to be bound? In a healthy dog-pupil relationship, the bond means that the dog is afraid that he can lose his owner. Your dog is afraid that he can lose you? Well, then no. You can test it by walking, when it doesn't pay attention, I turn around, and we have a virtual rubber band between us, this is called the binding rubber band, and if it can reach more than 20-30 meters, then our binding is still weak. The dog is not afraid to lose me. But the dog that is not afraid to lose its owner is not a dog yet, it is just a dog. And in order to become a dog, we have to build the connection, the feeling of the dog's sense of connection. How do we do this? For example, a very good technique is to hold the dog, we usually close the business like this, and the family runs away. And in the meantime, the dog reacts in three ways. Let me go, let me go! This is the best. Let me go, because my family is there! There is the other one, sorry if I let you go, because the most desirable. Let me go, because my family is there! This is the most desirable. There is the other one, that I'm sorry if I let you go, because the others left. It's not the right one, but still! And there is the third one, the flag march. Well, where should I run? Then they let me go, my dad. Okay. Well, with this practice, you can get there, if you practice it in a safe environment, you can get there, that the dog after a few such exercises, already spins, and especially if you do this with two or three dogs, and you put a flag march at the end of the line, the flag march also after two or three exercises, then the owner runs away and covers a tree behind him, he lets Fragmasz go, runs away, and reaches there. What am I actually looking for here? But this is completely fine here. There is no problem with this. It will be later. This is how we start to build it. I recommend you to practice this connection, and to try to hide it while walking, in safe it, hide behind a tree, in safe conditions while walking. And when the system works, then we just raise the bond to the real level, that is, we go out with the dog, that is... the forest, the ancient forest. And when he doesn't pay attention, The tree, the ancient tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree, the tree He looked at me and said, I'm really sleeping. I said, no. You hear me? You hear me? Where are you? Where are you? And of course, before he disappeared into the misty forest, I could give him signs, Indian signs, and when he came in, the happy and happy joy could come. That's when he becomes a dog. Yes, and when the happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live They disappeared. Oh, how frustrating! They are staring at me! Dad! In the case of Flagmark, we usually suggest a connection training. What is a connection training? Connection training is when, using the knowledge of the pastor, we build up to the ancient state, as the connection is formed on the sheep for example, everyone is a dear friend. The interaction is a large percentage, nearly 80%, the collection of food and the distribution of food is around the wolf wolf. Imagine when we take the dog home and start to feed him, to's a good idea to eat it. We say this about 80% of the time. This is a natural opposite. What kind of healthy dog is it? Always hungry. Always hungry. After the meal, it should always stay hungry for a little bit. And the binding training means that I take the meal, I don't give it to him. So if he has a binding problem, he doesn't that I take the food, I don't give it to him, so if he has a binding problem, he doesn't get it from the feed at home, but I take it out for walks, I distribute the full-value food for walks, so not the junk food, so what he gets at home, I take it out for walks with me in a nylon bag, I give it to the dog a nice call in a nylon bag. This is the binding training. And I have to do this for five weeks. Five weeks. Be careful, this is only when the dog is hungry. And during these five weeks, make sure the dog doesn't eat the ground food. No, no, no, not even the neighbor and the grandmother. Because we've seen that during the binding training, the didn't eat at the owner, but he still smelled. So, please pay attention to this, and especially to the fact that the dog should not be able to escape during this period, so that he can't jump out of the fence. So be careful, because this 5-7 can change our relationship very much. We win our place in the ancient social sphere, we explain to the dog that we are the ones who are responsible for it, we are the ones who direct it, we are the ones who bring it to the dog. Attention! The dog is not tied to the dog. I have never seen a dog who took the toy to the feeders and gave it to them. Or a who takes him to hunt and gives him food, and so on. Don't tell them about this, about the interactive field, about this, about the social space. Because it's a serious loss, which is very difficult to build from another place. And we always give the dog food in situations when it's hard to get in. So now I see that he's playing with the other dog, come here, there comes a wall. And we share the food for the walk, so that we take the last piece home. We take the last piece of the walk, and when we get into the apartment, the dog will get it. Let's not say that there is no more food. Haha, there is no more food. Why would I go in? I can feel the smell that there is no more food. Okay, my dear friends, this was serious. Thank you very much for your patience. That they could handle it. I have a good sense of radioactivity for everyone. I can see that we are radiating that many, many unpleasant notes from our truth. And I hope that you will use the success you have heard in this presentation with health. Thank you for your attention and I would like to let you go with this. Good luck and see you again!\n"
